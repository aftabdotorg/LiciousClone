        <p>When it comes to food, what is more comforting than a home-cooked chicken meal? Chicken recipes are always a

                We strive to bring you only the best! We are extremely meticulous about the meat we put on your plate.
                For this reason, our chicken produce is handpicked. We believe that chicken tastes best when fresh and

              <div class="faq-des">
                Chicken is best consumed fresh or on the day of its delivery, as it adds the best flavours to your dish.
                We do not recommend using frozen chicken, as it affects the taste, texture and nutritional properties of
                the meat. However, the meat, whether whole or cut, can be stored in a refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.

                The chicken must be stored in a refrigerator that is set at a temperature between 0 to 5 degrees. This
                is the same temperature that we maintain for the meat – from the time of procurement to the point of
                delivery.
