              <h3>About Licious Ready to Cook Products</h3>
              <p>When it comes to enjoying juicy and succulent bites of chicken, mutton or seafood, there is only one method that makes ready-to-cook dishes burst with flavour. And that is, the process of marination. The purpose of marinating meat is not only to give flavour, but to also tenderize the meat, which reduces cooking time in the final leg of preparation and helps you make a quick dish.</p>
              <p>We believe that an ideal marinade has three main components: aromatics/spices, oils and acids. The aromatics or spices uplift the flavour of the meat and can range from garlic and ginger, to onion, herbs and more. The oil in the marinade helps keep the meat from drying out. Acids such as lemon, vinegar or yoghurt which are commonly used in marinades, sharpen the flavour profiles of a dish.</p>
              <p>There are several occasions where you want a quick meal without much effort. Be it a time-pressed brunch or an easy dinner after a long day of work; ready-to-cook meats that are marinated or pre-cooked are your perfect option. We offer pre-marinated chicken, mutton and seafood options that prepared using all-natural ingredients, and are free of artificial flavours, colouring or preservatives. We believe in delivering you the freshest meats or seafood, and hence our ready-to-cook meats are prepared from the day’s freshest cuts or catch. Our in-house chefs also prepare other offerings such as Cutlets and Kebabs, which requires you to only sear or fry them in a pan!</p>
              <p>Our range of ready-to-cook products is as follows:
